# EIA Power Plant Data Processing

## What This Does

I built this to grab power plant data from EIA and use AI to find weird patterns. It takes the raw generation data and figures out which plants are performing unusually compared to what you would expect for their fuel type.

## Data Sources

I use the EIA API to get February 2025 monthly electricity generation data. I also have a CSV file with plant details like location and capacity. Then I send the processed data to DeepSeek AI to analyze capacity factors.

## How It Works

First I fetch about 5000 records from EIA API. Then I clean out the junk data like zero generation and summary records. After that I group everything by plant and merge it with the CSV database. The program asks you if you want to filter by specific states or regions before processing. Finally I calculate capacity factors and send batches to DeepSeek for analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Extra Credit Feature: Geographic Filtering

The program now lets you choose what to analyze:
- **All states** - Process everything (1100+ plants)
- **Specific states** - Enter state codes like "CA, TX, NY" 
- **Census regions** - Pick Northeast, Midwest, South, or West

This makes it way more useful for state-specific analysis or regional comparisons.

## What DeepSeek Does

The AI looks at each plant's capacity factor and decides if it looks normal for that fuel type. Nuclear plants running at 107% gets flagged differently than solar plants at 20% in winter. It understands that different fuel types have different normal ranges.

## Before and After

Before AI enhancement a nuclear plant at 107% just gets marked as "High". After DeepSeek analysis it gets "AI_High_Nuclear" which is way more useful. The AI knows that 107% for nuclear is high but reasonable while 107% for solar would be impossible.

## Setup

You need python 3.8 or newer. Install pandas numpy requests and python-dotenv. Make a .env file with your EIA_API_KEY and DS_API_KEY.

## Running It

Just run main.py and follow the prompts. It will ask you what geographic area to analyze then automatically run the complete pipeline including AI enhancement. The filtering happens before DeepSeek so you only pay for analyzing the plants you actually want.

## Output Files

data/raw/eia_api_data.json has the raw API response
data/raw/merged_plant_data.json has the cleaned and merged data  
data/enriched/merged_plant_data_enriched.json has the final AI analyzed data

## Results

I processed 1145 plants with 100% success rate. The AI created over 50 different flag categories. Most plants got flagged as normal but it found interesting patterns like high wind performance and low solar in winter.

## Features

Runs quietly with just progress updates. Has good error handling if APIs fail. Processes plants in batches of 25 to avoid rate limits. Calculates proper capacity factors using February days. Organizes everything into clean folders.
