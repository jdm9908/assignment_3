## üö® Critical Issue Detection

The AI system automatically detected that Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant reported a **121.68% capacity factor**, which is physically impossible. This triggers:

1. **Immediate Flag**: `Extreme_Nuclear`
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: "indicates potential data reporting issues"  
3. **Recommended Action**: "requiring immediate review"

**Business Impact**: Prevents incorrect analysis based on faulty data, ensures regulatory compliance, enables proactive maintenance planning.
